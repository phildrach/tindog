This is a sample mobile application website created with HTML5 CSS3 and Bootstrap 5. The site was designed by Dr. Angela Yu from AppBrewery and she provided and walkthrough tutorial on building out the site using Bootstrap 4.

Modifications needed to be made as Bootstrap 5 was released and so I rebuilt the site according to the modifications made under the Bootstrap 5 framework.

You can see the full design by downloading the project folders and running the index.html file on your local machine.
